Save your time, now yellow duck will do the job.\r\n\r\n# How to use:\r\n1. Go to any web page\r\n2. Click right button on value you're interested in, select \"Watch this item\" from context menu\r\n3. Test it (optionally) and save it.\r\n\r\n# How it works:\r\nEvery minute it loads all pages from listed items and finds specified values via CSS selectors.\r\n\r\n# Notes: \r\n- It's not always possible to automatically generate CSS selector, sometimes you'll need to set it manually\r\n- Extension checks items every minute, it does not show changed value immediately\r\n- It doesn't work with asynchronously loaded values (via AJAX)\r\n- Extension has some time limits on page loading, therefore sometimes it will be showing \"Not Available\" instead of real value, but it's rare cases","google":"UA-46743355-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
